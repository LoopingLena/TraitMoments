TraitMoments provides an efficient function to calculate mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis (all weighted by species relative abundance) of trait distribution across large community and traits datasets. The calculation is performed according to the equations number 1 to 4 from Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2017): 

\[
\small
Mean_{j} = \sum_{i}^{n} p_i T_i
\tag{1}
\]  


\[
\small
Variance_{j} = \sum_{i}^{n} p_i (T_i - Mean_j)^2
\tag{2}
\]  


\[
\small
Skewness_{j} = \sum_{i}^{n} \frac{p_i (T_i - Mean_j)^3}{Variance_j^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\tag{3}
\]  


\[
\small
Kurtosis_{j} = \sum_{i}^{n} \frac{p_i (T_i - Mean_j)^4}{Variance_j^2}
\tag{4}
\]  

where $p_i$ is the relative abundance and $T_i$ the trait value of the species _i_, _n_ is the number of species in a community _j_ with available trait information and the sum of relative abundance is equal to 100% for each community. Formulas 3 and 4 refer back to several works by Karl Pearson from the late 19th and early 20th century, which had a decisive influence on on the current understanding of skewness and kurtosis (see Fiori & Zenga 2009 or Doane & Seward 2011 for an overview).  

The calculation of all moments enables detailed insights into the shape of trait distributions. Enquist et al. (2015), Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2017) and Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2021) linked the moments of trait distributions to established frameworks of functional diversity and proposed the following terminology: The community-weighted mean (CWM) and the variance (CWV) allow for characterization of the functional dominance and dispersion respectively, while the skewness (CWS; asymmetry of a distributions) characterize the functional rarity and the kurtosis (CWK; relative “tailedness” or "peakedness" of a distribution) characterize the functional evenness. Negative or positive skewness strongly deviating from zero indicates a high functional rarity, while high kurtosis indicates a low functional evenness and vice versa. A broader interpretation of skewed trait distributions was proposed by Enquist et al. (2015): Skewed trait distributions indicate past or ongoing species turnover and/or environmental change as there is usually a time lag between growth and reproduction of immigrating species and the mortality of suppressed species. Figure 1 shows the precise relationship between moments and the shape of a distribution.

## Installation

Install the latest version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") # Run if not yet installed
devtools::install_github("SchreinerFR/TraitMoments")
```

## Load package and view documentation

Load the package and call the documentation for the function 'trait_moments':

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(TraitMoments)
?trait_moments
```

## Explore example data

TraitMoments comes with two example data frames that can be loaded with ‘data(trait_moments_data)’. The data frame 'communities' contains the relative abundances for 93 species from nine communities and 'traits' provides information on five traits for the corresponding species. For some species, no information is available for certain traits, so the data frame 'traits' contains some NAs. Since both data frames are quite large, we just inspect the heads in this example:

```{r, message=FALSE}
data(trait_moments_data)

communities[1:9,1:6] 
traits[1:6,1:5] 
```

## Calculate moments using ‘trait_moments’

### First: with default settings

Now we use the function 'trait_moments' to calculate the moments of all trait distributions for each trait and each community. The function will perform the calculation for all 45 combinations of trait and community at once. We just inspect the head of the result:

```{r}
result1 <- trait_moments(communities = communities, traits = traits)
dim(result1)
result1[1:20,1:ncol(result1)]
```


### Second: with settings to control the trade-off between reliable results and the number of NAs obtained

The first attempt resulted in a data frame that contains several NAs. This is because ‘trait_moments’ with default settings returns an NA  if the cumulative relative abundance of the species for which trait information is available is less than 80% or if there is missing information for at leased one of the four most dominant species. Many studies use a threshold value of 80% cumulative relative abundance for the calculation of community-weighted means (Bello et al. 2021). For the calculation of trait distribution moments, Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2017) introduced the additional threshold that, trait data should be available for the four most dominant species to avoid any breaks in the trait distributions. I strongly recommend applying these or even stricter criteria in order to obtain reliable results. However, ‘trait_moments’ contains arguments to control the trade-off between reliable results and the number of NAs obtained. By setting the arguments 'n_species = 1' and 'abundance = 50' we get a result that contains less NAs. 

```{r}
result2 <- trait_moments(communities = communities, traits = traits, n_species = 1, abundance = 50)
result2[1:20,1:ncol(result2)]
```

Conversely, the two arguments can also be used to apply stricter quality criteria. This could be appropriate if trait information is available for a large number of species. 

## Visualisation and ecological interpretation of trait distributions

Functions to visualise trait distributions are not yet available in ‘TraitMoments’, but I intend to implement it in later versions. There are basically two different ways to visualise trait distributions, either in the manner of histograms or as density estimation based on calculated moments. In the following I will demonstrate both approaches for the distributions of Trait 1 for Community 1, 5 and 9.

To prepare for visualisation as histogram, the abundance of the species for the three communities will be selected from the data frame 'community' and joined with the values for trait 1. The species are then divided into groups according to their trait values and within each group the sum of the relative abundances is calculated. Each group has the same range and the number of groups corresponds to the number of bars in the histogram:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse") # Run if not yet installed
library(tidyverse)

selected_communities <- as.data.frame(t(
  rbind(
  communities[1, 1:ncol(communities)],
  communities[5, 1:ncol(communities)],
  communities[9, 1:ncol(communities)],
  Trait.1 = traits$Trait.1
  )))
selected_communities[selected_communities == 0] <- NA

selected_communities$group <- "0.0 - 0.2"
selected_communities[selected_communities$Trait.1 > 0.2, ]$group <- "0.2 - 0.4"
selected_communities[selected_communities$Trait.1 > 0.4, ]$group <- "0.5 - 0.6"
selected_communities[selected_communities$Trait.1 > 0.6, ]$group <- "0.6 - 0.8"
selected_communities[selected_communities$Trait.1 > 0.8, ]$group <- "0.8 - 1.0"

hist_data <- selected_communities %>% 
    group_by(group) %>%
    summarise(
      Community.1 = sum(` Community.1`, na.rm=TRUE),
      Community.5 = sum(` Community.5`, na.rm=TRUE),
      Community.9 = sum(` Community.9`, na.rm=TRUE))

```


To perform a density estimation based on the calculated moments, we first select the moments provided by ‘trait_moments’ for the three distributions and use the package 'PearsonDS' to generate the input for the density estimation:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

selected_results <- rbind(
  result1[1, 1:ncol(result1)],
  result1[29, 1:ncol(result1)],
  result1[57, 1:ncol(result1)]
  )

# install.packages("PearsonDS") # Run if not yet installed
library(PearsonDS)
set.seed(123)
pearson_generation  <- rpearson(10000000,moments=c(mean = selected_results[1,3], variance = selected_results[1,4], skewness = selected_results[1,5], kurtosis = selected_results[1,6]))
dens_Community.1_Trait.1 <- density(pearson_generation)

pearson_generation  <- rpearson(10000000,moments=c(mean = selected_results[2,3], variance = selected_results[2,4], skewness = selected_results[2,5], kurtosis = selected_results[2,6]))
dens_Community.5_Trait.1 <- density(pearson_generation)

pearson_generation  <- rpearson(10000000,moments=c(mean = selected_results[3,3], variance = selected_results[3,4], skewness = selected_results[3,5], kurtosis = selected_results[3,6]))
dens_Community.9_Trait.1 <- density(pearson_generation)

```


Finally, we plot the density estimation based on calculated moments next to the corresponding histograms:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 6, fig.width=8, , fig.cap = "Figure 2: Distributions for trait 1 in the communies 1, 5 and 9 as density estimation based on calculated moments (left paneles) and histograms (right panels)."}

par(mfrow = c(3, 2))
plot(dens_Community.1_Trait.1, type="l", xlab="Trait value", ylab="Frequency", yaxt='n', main = "Community 1 Trait 1", xlim = c(0,1))
barplot(hist_data$Community.1, names.arg = hist_data$group, xlab="Trait value",ylab="Frequency", yaxt='n', main = "Community 1 Trait 1")
plot(dens_Community.5_Trait.1, type="l", xlab="Trait value", ylab="Frequency", yaxt='n', main = "Community 5 Trait 1", xlim = c(0,1))
barplot(hist_data$Community.5, names.arg = hist_data$group, xlab="Trait value", ylab="Frequency", yaxt='n', main = "Community 5 Trait 1")
plot(dens_Community.9_Trait.1, type="l",xlab="Trait value",ylab="Frequency", yaxt='n', main = "Community 9 Trait 1", xlim = c(0,1))
barplot(hist_data$Community.9, names.arg = hist_data$group, xlab="Trait value", ylab="Frequency", yaxt='n', main = "Community 9 Trait 1")

```


In order to interpret the visualisation together with the corresponding moments, we take a look at the values obtained from ‘trait_moments’ for the three distributions. 

```{r}
selected_results
```

First, we can state that the density estimations based on calculated moments and the histograms based on species trait values and abundance correspond quite well. We also note that the shape of the distributions is very distinct across the three communities. If we had only calculated the mean values and perhaps a measure for the dispersion - as is the case in many studies - some of these differences would have remained hidden. As mean and variance are regularly considered in functional ecology studies, I will emphasise how the distributions differ in terms of skewness and kurtosis. 

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. Community 1 is strongly skewed to the right (positive skew), while community 5 is slightly skewed to the left (negative skew) and community 9 is almost symmetric (skew close to zero). Applying the terminology of Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2021) to the three distributions, we could conclude that community 1 is characterised by a high functional rarity, as there are many rare species with infrequent trait values compared to the dominant species. In contrast, community 9 would be characterised by a very low functional rarity, as there are no rare species with uncommon trait values. 

Furthermore the three distributions differ with regard to the fourth moment, the kurtosis which is a characterization of a distributions “tailedness” or "peakedness". Community 1 is quite peaked around a value of approximately 0.2, but also has a tail that extends far to the right. Although the distribution for community 5 looks less peaked at first glance, it has the highest kurtosis, as its tails are less pronounced than those of community 1. The distribution for community 9 has the least marked peak and short tails, i.e. a low kurtosis, which in the sense of Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2021) would be indicative for a high functional evenness.  


## Final note on community-weighted means (CWMs)

The function 'functcomp' from the package 'FD' is frequently used to calculate CWMs. In the following I will demonstrate that ‘functcomp’ and ‘trait_moments’ return exactly the same values, however ‘trait_moments’ enables to specify a threshold for the cumulative relative abundance for which trait information should be present.  

First we inspect the output of 'functcomp':

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("FD") # Run if not yet installed
library(FD)
functcomp(traits, as.matrix(communities))
```

As already stated above, in many cases it is advisable to set a threshold value of 80 % for the cumulative relative abundance. This can be achieved via 'trait_moments' if we set 'n_species = 0' and 'abundance = 80':

```{r}
result <- trait_moments(communities, traits, n_species = 0, abundance = 80)
result[1:20,1:ncol(result)]
```

We receive a warning that CWMs but no moments can be calculated if we set 'n_species = 0'. Since this is our goal in this special case we can ignore this warning. 'Trait_moments' generates exactly the same CWMs as 'functcomp', but if there is not suficient trait information to obtain reliable results (level can be chosen by the user), it returns NAs. If we set 'n_species = 0' and 'abundance = 0', the two functions return exactly the same result.
